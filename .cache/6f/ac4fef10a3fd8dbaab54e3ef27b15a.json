I have worked in audio and music production for over thirteen years and have been doing sound design for games since in 2011. It was at this time that I discovered the world of indie games and, being completely enthralled by it, decided to invest my time and resources into making a career in games. Since then, I have immersed myself into the world-wide community of game developers, absorbing as much knowledge as possible along the way. Each aspect of game design informs every other aspect, so the more I learn the better I can do my job as a sound designer. Each game I work on is its own creative adventure and exploring new concepts/challenges is always super exciting!</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"services\" class=\"section\">\n        <h2>Mes prestations</h2>\n        <p>Toutes mes prestations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"grid-services\">\n        <div class=\"service\">\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"/761941d4b5e698acbd67d0c7900f0020.svg\" alt=\"\">\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <span>Indiquer la prestation</span>\n                <p>Interactive audio design is about creating sound systems that will complement all the other systems that make up your game.
